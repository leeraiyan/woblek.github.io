            The PAP has acknowledged climate change as an existential threat to Singapore. In response, it aspires to “game change climate change.” However, its actions have not matched up with its rhetoric. Were all countries to follow the government’s most recent 2030 emissions target, there would be global warming of 3-4ºC. Meeting the government’s 2030 target does not require a major decarbonisation of Singapore's industries and energy supply — the primary sources of local emissions — and is thus inadequate. Though the government scored highly on transport and waste, these sectors contribute relatively less to carbon emissions. While much of the government’s climate policy and spending are focused on adaptation to rising sea levels and food security, it is unclear if these measures will be equitable and targeted to address the needs of disadvantaged communities. On the whole, the government’s policies show a tendency to maintain the status quo. However, its response to the COVID-19 epidemic shows that it is capable of bold action if it chooses to treat the climate crisis like the pressing emergency that it is.

    In its 2020 climate change policy paper, the SDP rightly emphasises the urgency of the climate crisis, acknowledging both the inadequate status quo and need for bolder measures. The SDP has the political will to tackle environmental issues, and for this it attains a marginally higher score than the incumbent government in Greenwatch’s scoring metrics. The SDP did well in the energy, nature and industry categories, where it calls out the continued support for the extractive fossil fuel and palm oil sectors, and points to the need to expand access to renewable energy. The party also scored well in the collective action and equity categories, owing to its longstanding support for civil society and its advocacy of expanded social welfare policies. However, the party often fell short when it came to the details of their proposals. For example, even though the party said it would “significantly upgrade” Singapore’s pledge under the Paris Agreement, no specific figure was given. In contrast, the current government has put forth an updated target in 2020.
 However, the SDP should be cautious in linking the population issue with climate change, as this has deep historical linkages with the xenophobic politics of the far right. While the party has explicitly said that it opposes xenophobic discourses, Greenwatch would like to see further assurances that the party does not step down this path.

                        <p>Ahead of the coming general election, the Greenwatch team hopes that the climate crisis will be seen by political parties and voters alike with the seriousness that it deserves. To serve as a guide on climate policies, we have prepared our own Climate Scorecard, a tool to measure the ambition each party shows in their manifestos and campaigns to tackle climate change. We aim for this to benefit both parties and voters. For parties, we hope that our scorecard can be a useful framework to ensure that policies address the many dimensions of climate change. For voters, we hope that this can be a helpful guide in understanding what is at stake with climate change, and where each party stands.

                    <h3 class="title is-4">Green Transition</h3>
                    <p>The green transition demands that we think seriously about how we live with each other and how
                        our world is interconnected. The climate crisis is not just an environmental problem, but it is a problem borne out of years
                        of unequal relationships; with our planet and also, with one another. Conducting extractive activities on the land of vulnerable
                        communities to satiate our greed for fossil fuel energy is an apt example of how the climate crisis is built on the extensive exploitation of our earth and people. This transition will allow us to reflect on histories upon histories of social, political and economic injustices and oppression. It will allow us to reexamine our priorities, how our focus on economic growth has caused the planet to suffer and how unjust our societies have become because we did not value the wellbeing of all. And it will also allow us to realise a net-zero carbon society, with mass adoption of renewable energy, and a world under 1.5 degrees of warming. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The green transition must be one premised on equity, collaboration and compassion. Policies for the green transition must be structural in nature and must move us towards transforming all facets of government and society. This will ensure that future generations will have a much fairer world to live in. The government must also allow for more citizen engagement and must take into account the voices of all citizens, including the ones who may be currently kept out of conversations due to socio-political and cultural barriers; the policy-making process must be more accessible and transparent. Finally, the green transition must also acknowledge the rights of various environmental entities—natural spaces, ecosystems, and individual species—that share this earth with us.

                        <p>Greenwatch is a politically nonpartisan campaign. Our scoring is meant to reflect Greenwatch’s assessment of the government’s policies based on our environmental criteria, which draws upon and applies the recommendations of IPCC and other renowned climate science to Singapore’s context.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We have created a scale from -3 to 3 to evaluate the government’s policies in relation to our recently released policy brief. A positive score means that the government has entirely, substantially or partially met our ask(s). A score of NA means that the party has not articulated any policy on that environmental criteria. A negative score means either that (a) the party might have made positive commitments, but we have considerable doubt or concerns about the legitimacy of these commitments or (b) that the party has committed to policy actions that lead to more carbon emissions and exacerbate the climate crisis.

                                    <li>Singapore’s 2020 update to its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), our emissions target, does not change the level of carbon emissions we aim for in 2030. <a href="https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Singapore%20First/Singapore%20INDC.pdf" target="blank">In 2015</a>, Singapore targeted reducing emissions as a factor of GDP by 36% (below 2005 levels), by 2030. At the time, the 2030 target was estimated to be 65 MTCO2e based on projected GDP growth. <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/speeches/speech-by-senior-minister-and-coordinating-minister-for-national-security-teo-chee-hean-committee-of-supply-2020-28-february-2020" target="_blank">In 2020</a>, Singapore targeted an absolute peak emission level of 65 MtCO2e around 2030. The 2015 and 2020 targets are similar.</li>
                                    <li>The updated target of 65 MTCO2e by 2030 is ~28% above <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-inventory" target="blank">2014 emissions</a> of 50.9 MTCO2e. Singapore needs to considerably improve its reduction target.</li>
                                    <li>The second part of the new NDC, which aims to reach half of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/spores-2050-target-halve-emissions-from-2030-peak" target="blank">2030's emissions by 2050</a>, also lacks ambition. Half of 2030 emissions (65 MtCO2e) is 33 MtCO2e, which would mean only a return to 1997 emission levels according to <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/singapore/" target="blank">Climate Action Tracker’s data.</a> In order to keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees celsius, net global emissions <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/" target="blank">need</a> to reach 0 MtCO2e by 2050</li>
                                    <li>There appears to be no desire to meet the IPCC target for 1.5 degree warming. PM Lee Hsien Loong has declared that it is <a href="https://mothership.sg/2020/03/pm-lee-covid-19-interview-transcript/" target="blank">not practical</a> for Singapore to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>In Parliament in 2019, PAP MP Dr Lim Wee Kiak <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/day-2-budget-debate-mps-ask-easy-access-data-and-climate-change-act" target="blank">said</a> that “Singapore should consider enacting a Climate Change Act” which legally binds the country to meeting its climate targets. Countries like <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/tackling-climate-change/the-legal-landscape/the-climate-change-act/" target="blank">Britain</a> and <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/climate-change-act/id2593351/" target="blank">Norway</a> have put in place a Climate Change act; Malaysia has been <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/05/16/yeo-at-least-24-months-for-climate-change-act-to-be-tabled-if-necessary/1753644" target="blank">scoping</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-to-draft-climate-change-act-formulate-national-adaptation-and-mitigation-plan" target="blank">drafting</a> a Climate Change Act. However, since this mention of the Act in Parliament, it has not been discussed further.</li>
                    <li>That said, the PAP government has made several encouraging commitments to tackle climate change. In Budget 2020, Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat <a href="https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/budget-speech/d-sustaining-singapores-success-for-our-future-generations#s1" target="blank">detailed</a> several new national climate policies, including ambitious transport electrification, HDB Green Towns Programs, and a Coastal Protection Fund. In 2016, the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) published a paper <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publications/take-action-today-for-a-carbon-efficient-singapore.pdf" target="blank">detailing</a> various business- and household-centred policies to “Improve Energy and Carbon Efficiency, Reduce Emissions in Power Generation, Deploy Low-Carbon Technology, and Encourage Collective Climate Action.”</li>
                    <li>The creation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) within the Prime Minister’s Office in 2007 reflects a Whole-of-Government approach to climate change. The <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/who-we-are/inter-ministerial-committee-on-climate-change/" target="blank">IMCCC</a> was established to coordinate across governments to reduce our emissions and to prepare for the consequences of climate change.</li>
                    <li>Singapore also contributes to the reduction of emissions in the <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media-centre/parliamentary-replies/parliamentary-reply-by-senior-minister-teo-chee-hean-on-ministries-climate-compliance" target="blank">aviation</a> and <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media-centre/parliamentary-replies/parliamentary-reply-by-senior-minister-teo-chee-hean-on-ministries-climate-compliance" target="blank" >maritime</a> industry. Singapore sits on the council of the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-re-elected-to-international-maritime-organisation-council" target="blank">International Maritime Organisation</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/singapore-re-elected-to-icao-council" target="blank">International Civil Aviation Organisation</a> to tackle international transport emissions. The PAP government has announced that it <a href="https://www.mot.gov.sg/news-centre/news/Detail/speech-by-senior-minister-of-state-for-transport-and-health-lam-pin-min-at-the-ministry-of-transport-s-committee-of-supply-debate-2020-sustainable-competitive-industries-and-sustainable-environment-with-a-focus-on-aviation-maritime-and-active-mobility/" target="blank">will participate in</a> (1) the voluntary phase of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to freeze carbon footprint, improve energy efficiency and study the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and (2) launch the Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint 2050 next year, placing $40 million under the Maritime GreenFuture Fund. </li>

                    <p>It would be more effective for the PAP government to dedicate a portion of the annual national budget to climate mitigation or adaptation measures, under a centralised body responsible for disbursing these funds. Such a structure would improve the transparency and coordination of these efforts. As of now, the PAP government has been investing large amounts in areas that it has pledged to tackle: Energy Efficiency, Solar Capacity, Green Finance, Electrification, and Adaptation. </p>

                        <li>There is no timeline for decarbonisation, and WP has not articulated how it will protect the livelihoods affected by the green transition. </li>
                        <li>However, their Redundancy Insurance scheme, which will provide a payout of 40% of a worker’s last drawn salary for up to six months (up to a monthly cap of 40% of the prevailing median wage), should the worker be made redundant, does show that the party recognises the need to protect the livelihood of workers. Whether or not this scheme will be robust enough to deal with the potential unemployment caused by the climate crisis remains to be seen.</li>
                        <li>Also, in the 2020 Debate on Annual Budget, Leon Perera articulated that “an incentive scheme could be deployed to attract local workers into sectors like renewable energy” when thinking about Singapore’s mid and long term outlooks. This demonstrates some foresight, suggesting that WP understands the need to shift away from current industries.</li>

                        The party has thus far articulated that Singapore should move away from its reliance on fossil fuels and that a shift to renewable energy will create new jobs. However, it has yet to publish a comprehensive, transparent, and robust blueprint for the green transition.

                        The party does not articulate how the climate crisis may disproportionately harm existing marginalised groups, save for remarks on food prices. More broadly, however, the party has acknowledged Singapore’s complicity in destructive practices like sand mining and the financing of corporations that perpetuate transboundary haze.
                        Additionally, the party has chastised Singapore’s prevailing economic growth model, linking it to other socio-political injustices like wealth inequality and migrant rights. While the party has denounced rising xenophobia in Singapore, it remains to be seen how the party will tackle this issue.

                        <li>The party acknowledges the destructive sand mining practices that Singapore has benefited from, saying that “the mining of sand in these countries has caused major conservation issues for the region and destroyed local ecosystems.” (p.19)</li>
                        <li>The party recognises complicity in the issue of transboundary haze, saying: “Singapore should be banned from investing in or financing corporations that have been found to be involved, directly or otherwise, in the burning of forests in Indonesia and Malaysia”. This point, and the previous one, demonstrate SDP’s awareness of extractivism, intersectionality and power dynamics (p.22).</li>
                        <li>The party has also linked Singapore’s population growth targets to climate issues like the continuous need to reclaim land, the worsening of the urban heat island effect, and our ability to adapt to rising sea levels (p.7,19).</li>
                        <li>While the party clarifies that it “welcomes foreign workers into our economy”, suggests that a minimum wage should be applied to all workers, and asserts that Singapore “must ensure that Singaporeans do not embrace ugly nationalism and xenophobia,” no proposals are raised for tackling this phenomenon (p.20).</li>

                        While energy efficiency measures have been widely adopted, overall energy demand is still projected to rise until about 2030. Singapore’s consumption of electricity has been rising year-on-year since at least 2012. Looking to the future, electricity demand is still expected to rise until at least 2030. Much of this demand comes from the industry sector.

                        <li>Progress on collaboration with regional partners, in particular through the ASEAN Power Grid, remains slow in spite of the massive endowment of renewable resources in the region. Most of the headway made has been limited to the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/establishing-multilateral-power-trade-in-asean" target="blank">bilateral development of transmission infrastructure and trade.</a></li>
                        <li>Even with the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/establishing-multilateral-power-trade-in-asean" target="blank">Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS–PIP)</a>, a “pathfinder” multilateral power trading project, the Singapore government appears lukewarm in its commitment. As it stands today, the LTMS–PIP involves only the sale of electricity from Lao PDR to Malaysia, with Thailand acting as a transit country.</li>
                        <li>There has been, nonetheless, some progress on this front. The government has announced the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/20b-plan-to-supply-solar-power-from-australia-to-spore" target="blank">Australia-Singapore Power Link</a>, a long distance solar transmission project with Australia mooted for 2030. The Australia-Singapore Power Link is projected to supply a fifth of Singapore's power needs, helping to ease its dependence on imported liquefied natural gas.   </li>
                        <li>The Singapore government has also announced a <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/press-releases/30122019-ccg_mrp-hdb-increases-solar-target-from-220-mwp" target="blank">2GWp target for solar energy by 2030</a> (equivalent to 10% of Singapore’s peak daily electricity demand), with plans to fit <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Speeches/2019/10/Speech-by-Minister-Chan-Chun-Sing-at-the-12th-Singapore-International-Energy-Week-2019" target="blank">one in two HDB rooftops with solar panels</a> over the upcoming years.

They have recognised that fossil fuels have a limited role in Singapore’s long term energy needs, but haven’t said anything concrete about disavowing the fossil fuel industry. They also continue to push for the expansion of the petrochemical industry.</p>

                        <li>Minister for Trade and Industry (MTI) Chan Chun Sing has said that Singapore is <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-will-to-defy-the-odds-of-history" target="blank">“thinking of a future away from fossil fuels”</a>, but has also said that natural gas will remain the dominant energy source for the next <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/natural-gas-to-remain-spores-key-energy-fuel-for-50-years" target="blank">50 years</a>. Worryingly, the faith that oil giants such as <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/02/09/exxonmobil-gambles-on-growth" target="blank">Exxonmobil</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-climate-exclusive/exclusive-no-choice-but-to-invest-in-oil-shell-ceo-says-idUSKBN1WT2JL" target="blank">Shell</a> are also thinking of a future beyond fossil fuel seems misplaced. In 2019 Chan called Exxonmobil a “close and trusted partner” of Singapore at the multi-billion dollar expansion of its manufacturing complex on Jurong Island</li>
                        <li>Even though the government claims that Singapore’s petrochemical industry is amongst the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-has-wealth-of-new-opportunities-to-exploit-chan" target="blank">cleanest</a> in the world, it now <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-about-75-of-industrial-emissions-are-from-refining-and-petrochemicals-sector" target="blank">accounts</a> for close to half of Singapore’s emissions together with the oil and gas industry.</li>

                        The SDP has advocated for Singapore to move away from an oil-centric economy and to choose other energy sources besides Liquid Natural Gas (LNG). However, the party has not provided a concrete plan for this transition.

        <p>By putting a price on carbon emissions, we ensure that the price of fossil fuels includes the cost of climate disruption and leverage the capacity of the market to enable emissions reductions. That said, carbon pricing is not a silver bullet and must be accompanied by other ambitious policies. Carbon pricing can be evaluated in three aspects: 1) Price 2) Coverage of carbon emitting institutions 3) How the carbon tax revenue is used. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The current and projected carbon tax rates are highly insufficient. Currently, the carbon tax is set at <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/climate-change-and-singapore/reducing-emissions/carbon-tax" target="blank">$5 per tonne of Carbon Dioxide emitted for industrial facilities that emit over 25,000 tCO2e</a>. Singapore <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/carbon-tax" target="blank">will review</a> the carbon tax rate by 2023, with plans to increase it to between $10 and $15 per tonne of GHG emissions by 2030. </li>
                        <li>Although there is no single ideal carbon price out there as that is dependent on the country’s energy mix and climate policies, Singapore’s current and targeted rates are still clearly too low. Numerous figures have been proposed as guidelines for an “optimal” carbon price. <a href="https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/news/2017/5/25/leading-economists-a-strong-carbon-price-needed-to-drive-large-scale-climate-action" target="blank">A report</a> by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices, chaired by Joseph Stiglitz and Lord Nicholas Stern, recommends that a tax of at least US$40–80 per tonne by 2020, rising to US$50–100 in 2030 is necessary in order to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement.</li>
                        <li>In a book titled “The Climate Casino” by pioneering environmental economist William Nordhaus where he analysed 13 models on carbon prices, he found an average carbon price of approximately US$30 per tonne in 2020 rising to US$55 in 2030 is necessary in order to keep to a 2.5°C target. His own economic modelling of the social costs of climate change, suggests an “optimal” scenario of 3.5°C of warming in 2100, where the 2015 social cost of carbon is US$30 per tonne, rising to US$42 in 2025. Adjusting the model to a 2.5°C warming projection, by contrast, brings this social cost of carbon upwards of US$200 per tonne from 2020 onwards.</li>
                        <li>Others suggest that the carbon price should be pitched at a level that incentivises utilising carbon capture technologies, which optimistic estimates say are possible at least <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/its-possible-to-reverse-climate-change-suggests-major-new-study/562289/" target="blank">US$100 per tonne.</a></li>
                        <li>Further, there is a lack of information on how the carbon tax rates were decided and how they will contribute to emissions reductions.</li>

                    <p>It is unclear if or how the revenues are redistributed to citizens. The carbon tax revenue should be progressively redistributed to households according to needs.

                        <li>It is unclear if or how the carbon tax revenue is redistributed to citizens.

Revenues will be used to fund green initiatives via two existing schemes: the Productivity Grant (Energy Efficiency) and the Energy Efficiency Fund. This includes measures by industry to reduce emissions and providing measures to ease the transition.</li>
                        <li>The impact on households has been estimated to be <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2018-carbon-tax-of-5-per-tonne-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-be-levied" target="blank">about 1% point increase in total electricity and gas expenses on average.</a> <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2018-carbon-tax-of-5-per-tonne-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-be-levied" target="blank">Households will get help in the form of additional utilities rebates</a> through the GST Voucher U-Save scheme.

                        The SDP advocated for carbon tax revenue to be used to install Solar PVs, which is similar to the current policy of channeling the revenue towards green initiatives. However, they have not indicated anything beyond that one particular measure.

                        <li>The party has mentioned in passing that the carbon tax revenue should be used to install Solar PVs. This is in line with their push to switch to solar energy, with the party saying that “Singapore has plenty of roof space to accommodate PV panels.”(p.15)</li>

                        <li>According to the NCCS*, the PAP government aims to make Singapore a green finance hub and to develop a circular economy, in which low-carbon and sustainable solutions are to be test-bedded and exported globally. These efforts are intended not only “to grow [Singapore’s] economy and create more jobs for Singaporeans, but also allow [Singapore] to support abatement efforts beyond our shores”. However, the government has yet to produce a clear road map articulating how and when these ambitions will be realised.</li>

In February 2019, the grant scheme was <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/sustainable-bond-grant-scheme" target="blank">expanded</a> to include social and sustainability bonds, and renamed as the Sustainable Bond Grant (SBG) Scheme. The minimum issuance size requirement was lowered and the grant scheme was extended to end May 2023.</li>
                        <li>In November 2019, the MAS further <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/green-finance-led-spore-can-help-mobilise-global-action-against-climate-change-ong-ye-kung" target="blank">announced</a> a US$2 billion green investments programme (GIP) to support “public market investment strategies that have a strong green focus”. The first investment under the GIP will be a US$100m placement in the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) Green Bond Investment Pool (GBIP).</li>
                        <li>Devoting more investment into sustainable initiatives is a welcome move, and the PAP government appears committed to mobilising more capital to drive low-carbon solutions. However, more standardisation and clarification are needed as to what projects are counted as “green”.</li>

                        <li>In Budget 2020, Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat <a href="https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/budget-speech/d-sustaining-singapores-success-for-our-future-generations#s1" target="blank">said</a> that the PAP government would be committing $5 billion to a “Coastal and Flood Protection Fund.”</li>

                        <li>A National Resilience Framework has also been <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publications/a-climate-resilient-singapore-for-a-sustainable-future.pdf" target="blank">established</a> to identify and assess climate change risks and impacts, and formulate adaptation plans to address Singapore’s vulnerabilities.</li>

                        <li>Regarding food, a key area of vulnerability for Singapore, Parliament has <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/singapores-30-30-food-production-target-it-feasible" target="blank">articulated</a> targeting a “30 by 30 Strategy” to increase Singapore’s food production to make up 30% of supply. This is accompanied by Enterprise Singapore <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/super-fish-speedy-rice-singapores-farming-revival" target="blank">appointing</a> seven partners to co-invest in Singaporean agri-food start-ups in 2019.</li>
                        <li>Singapore also aims to facilitate the introduction of alternative proteins that are produced more sustainably and productively. The <a href="https://www.mewr.gov.sg/news/speech-by-mr-masagos-zulkifli--minister-for-the-environment-and-water-resources--at-the-committee-of-supply-debate--4-march-2020" target="blank">first research grant call</a> was launched last December by the Singapore Food Authority and A*STAR under the Singapore Food Story R&D Programme.</li>
                        <li>To strengthen the region’s financial resilience to disaster risks and address protection gaps, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has set up <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/2019/reply-to-cos-cuts-on-gems-corporate-governance-and-sustainable-financing" target="blank">Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility</a> as ASEAN’s first regional catastrophe risk pool.

        <p>The land transport sector accounts for about 14% of Singapore’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and is mostly powered by vehicles that run on petroleum. Thus, Singapore urgently needs to reduce car use and convert all vehicles to clean energy in order to reduce emissions from this sector.</p>

                        <li>In the Centre for Liveable Cities’ (CLC) <a href="https://www.clc.gov.sg/docs/default-source/books/carlite-urban-mobility-finalreport.pdf" target="blank">report on car-lite urban mobility</a>, one of the recommended strategies is to “put a stop to cheap and easy parking and reflect the full cost of driving.” The report also argues for more street reclamation and that “a paradigm shift towards ‘car-lite’ mobility requires a fundamental review of the way cities design their streets, such that multimodal streets that look after the safety and needs of all users are no longer treated as special projects, but as a norm for all road network expansion and improvement projects.”</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.corenet.gov.sg/media/2187065/changes-to-ltas-car-parking-standards-and-gazetting-of-designated-car-lite-precincts.pdf" target="blank">LTA’s new range-based parking provision standards</a> still have minimum requirements e.g. 1 parking lot per 1.25 residential units, whereas other cities like San Francisco and Mexico City <a href="https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2019/09/parking-lot-urban-planning-transit-street-traffic-congestion/598504/" target="blank">have removed their minimum parking limits</a> and converted them into maximum limits.</li>

                    <p>Singapore has aggressively increased its goals for expanding cycling paths, but more work is needed to achieve higher cycling path densities that are comparable to other bike-friendly cities, and wider paths with better segregation for a safer cycling experience. The public transport mode share is still lower than other cities like Hong Kong and Seoul though there are plans to increase the rail density to be comparable to London and New York City. Lastly, the pedestrian experience can be improved with wider and more sheltered paths.</p>

                    <p>Singapore’s unique socio-political and cultural context has limited the emergence of movements that present dissenting views. However, the government does indeed support select ground-up initiatives, especially youth-led ones, through various forms.</p>

                        <li>The government is not always agreeable towards <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/singapore-does-not-need-sycophants-it-needs-loving-critics" target="blank">differing opinions and views</a> in Singapore. People have called for the government <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/liberal-education-makes-for-better-citizens-nmp" target="blank">to expand</a> liberal education in Singapore so as to develop more critical Singaporeans.</li>
                        <li>Though contentious, Singapore ranks low on the <a href="https://www.mci.gov.sg/pressroom/news-and-stories/pressroom/2004/11/mcis-response-to-pq-on-press-freedom" target="blank">world press freedom ranking report</a>.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, laws that have a broad reach such as the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/POA2009" target="blank">Public Order Act</a> can create uncertainties in movement-building and the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/yellow-ribbon-run-anti-death-penalty-t-shirts-police-investigate-11914002" target="blank">vocalising of opinions.</a></li>

The “<a href="https://www.nyc.gov.sg/en/initiatives/grants/national-youth-fund/" target="blank">National Youth Fund</a> (NYF) supports ground-up youth initiatives to champion community and social causes through partnerships with Youth Sector Organisations (YSO) including youth social enterprises, schools, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) and other community partners.”, <a href="https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sparkthenext" target="blank">SG Youth Action Plan</a> with "up to $50,000 in grants to support youth-led innovations", and a $50 million <a href="https://www.mewr.gov.sg/news/new-sg-eco-office-and-50-million-sg-eco-fund-to-promote-environmental-sustainability-in-communities" target="blank">SG Eco Fund</a> to support sustainability projects that nudge people and communities towards environmentally-friendly behaviour.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, the government has historically <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mps-respond-to-climate-rallygoers-ideas" target="blank">praised and affirmed</a> various ground-up movements</li>

                        <li>There is still a lack of transparency from the government. For instance, there is currently no information on key data that could reflect Singapore’s commitment to combating the climate crisis, such as the amount of investment in overseas coal projects, or a timeline for a green transition, or how the carbon tax has been calculated. This lack of data also prevents the public from keeping the government accountable to targets and metrics.</li>

This shows that some data is available but not shared in a timely and proactive manner. The <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-govt-to-make-environment-impact-assessments-public-unless-there-are-security" target="blank">EIA Results of Tenga</a> were not disclosed in full</li>
                        <li>Instead of transparency, rhetorical diversions are employed.

                    <p>There are some shortfalls to the Ministry of Education’s current curricula. More broadly, state-wide campaigns largely focus on individual action and tend to skirt around the biggest emitters- industries. Many campaigns choose to disproportionately highlight the role of households and individuals.</p>

                            <p>Singapore has long prioritised economic gains over environmental protection. Increases in green spaces are mostly attributed to urban greening. Huge imports of sand has also led to the destruction of natural spaces in other countries.Where biodiversity has been lost within Singapore, there has been some effort put into restoring or re-establishing lost species and natural ecosystems. Some targets related to reporting carbon stock and carbon flux in vegetation and land use, restoring selected ecosystems and tree planting have been set.</p>

                                    <li>Minimal focus has been put into achieving net zero embodied carbon, which accounts for the carbon footprint of all materials used in the entire process from construction to operational.
